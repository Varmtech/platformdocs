Channel is where the conversations happen and users send messages to each other. In order to send and read messages, the user needs to be a member of a channel. We provide 3 types of channels: Public, Private and Direct. Each channel has its own use cases.  
## Public channel ##
Public Channel is an open chat with a number of online members. Any user can access, join, and leave the Public Channel without permission. It is suitable for discussions, announcements, and promotions.  
 
## Private channel ##
Private Channels are only visible for its members. Only a limited number of users can participate in the channel. Private Channels are used for discussing confidential or sensitive topics. Only the members of the channel can send and receive messages. Other members can add users to the channel. If users don't wish to join the channel 
they can leave the channel and block it to not be added several times to the same channel.



## Direct Channel ##
With Direct Channel, you can send 1-on-1 messages to another member. Any user in your application can send and receive direct messages.
