Platform API consists of different types of data resources related to chat activities. It allows you to directly interact with these resources, using HTTP protocol requests. Chat API is based on RESTful guidelines, it uses standard HTTP protocols and returns JSON payloads in response to HTTP requests. 
<p>
Chat API makes it comfortable to customize chat features and services from the server-side. With Chat API your backend servers can communicate with our platform and perform various administrative actions like:
</p>

- Managing channels
- Users 
- Messages
- Uploading, downloading, and deleting files

## Base URL ##

API calls are performed using the Base URL on every request. The
request must also include an API key in the header for authentication.
<p>
The following Base URL is used for the Chat API.</p>

```
                    https://{{apiUrl}}/v1/{{appId}}/
```


The first part of the URL remains unchanged. Based on API request type a specific endpoint is added to the base URL
 For example ``/application``

Requests containing similar endpoints can perform different actions depending on the information and parameters included in the header.


## Authentication ##


The API requests must be authenticated by our server. To authenticate the request, you need to use an API token. You can find the API token in your dashboardâ€¦
For each HTTPS request, you must include the API token in the authentication header.

## URL encoding ##

Request URLs containing characters outside of the ASCII  table must all be encoded into a valid ASCII format. Url encoding converts unsafe ASCII characters with ``%`` followed by two hexadecimal digits.

For example, if you have a parameter containing a non-ASCII character like username_new*user is encoded to username_new%2Auser.
